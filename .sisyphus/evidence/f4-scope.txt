VERDICT: PASS

Baseline: cb7bf7a (origin/main)
Range inspected: cb7bf7a..HEAD

Commit mapping (allowed scope attribution)
- 6b3f2c6 feat(kinds): persist and filter notes by kind -> kinds feature
- ff2a20c feat(ui): add kind chips and social embeds -> social embeds
- bdee605 feat(api): add urls-csv import and batch patch -> explicitly accepted extra endpoints
- 34e31ee chore: update deps and misc refactors -> deps/tooling refactors

Scope creep check
- Unacknowledged scope creep: none found in commit-level attribution.

Workspace hygiene checks
- .sisyphus status: untracked only (`git status --porcelain=v1` shows `?? .sisyphus/`).
- New dependencies: only `python-multipart>=0.0.22` added in `pyproject.toml`, with corresponding lockfile entry in `uv.lock`; rationale consistent with multipart/form upload support needed by urls-csv import endpoint.
- Secret/credential scan on files changed in cb7bf7a..HEAD: no matches for `.env`/API-key/private-key/token/password leak patterns.

Risks / follow-ups
- `34e31ee` includes broad refactors alongside dependency change; if tighter traceability is needed, consider splitting dependency-only vs refactor-only commits in future.

VERDICT: PASS

Baseline: cb7bf7a (origin/main)
Range inspected: cb7bf7a..HEAD

Commit mapping (allowed buckets only)
- 6b3f2c6 feat(kinds): persist and filter notes by kind -> kinds feature.
- ff2a20c feat(ui): add kind chips and social embeds -> social embeds.
- bdee605 feat(api): add urls-csv import and batch patch -> accepted extra endpoints.
- 34e31ee chore: update deps and misc refactors -> deps/tooling (plus internal refactors supporting accepted endpoint flow; no new product surface beyond approved buckets).
- 690197b fix(api): qualify notes.id in note-kind counts filter -> kinds API/storage correctness bugfix (approved kinds bucket).

Dependency/tooling re-confirmation
- `pyproject.toml` adds only `python-multipart>=0.0.22`.
- `uv.lock` delta is the corresponding lock update for `python-multipart==0.0.22`.
- Rationale remains valid: multipart form upload handling needed by CSV import endpoint.

Verification checks
- `git status --porcelain=v1`: `?? .sisyphus/` only (no tracked workspace drift).
- Secret-pattern quick scan on range-changed files (`token|password|key` + literal-assignment probe): no committed secret literals; `key` hits are structural/code identifiers and `instagram_password` usage reads runtime config only.
